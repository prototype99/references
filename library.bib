This paper envisions a system called PhonePoint Pen that uses the in-built accelerometer in mobile phones to recognize human writing. By holding the phone like a pen, a user should be able to write short messages or draw simple diagrams in the air. The acceleration due to hand gestures can be translated into geometric strokes, and recognized as characters. We prototype the PhonePoint Pen on the Nokia N95 platform, and evaluate it through real users. Results show that English characters can be identified with an average accuracy of 91.9\%, if the users conform to a few reasonable constraints. Future work is focused on refining the prototype, with the goal of offering a new user-experience that complements keyboards and touch-screens. © 2011 ACM.},

  abstract = {Playing a first person shooter (FPS) game using a gamepad is inherently more difficult than playing it with a mouse. In this study, we propose a novel input method for gamepads to improve the FPS aim task. We take a user-centric approach to identify unused secondary motions to be indicative of players’ intents. We consider the gamepad tilt as a secondary motion that users naturally perform while playing with the gamepad, and interpret it as the intent of the user to move the FPS aim faster. We use a tilt sensor to detect the amount of tilt, and use it to increase the sensitivity of the gamepad analog joystick when the gamepad is tilted. We compare this to two other input methods: a pure gamepad and a tilt-aim scheme. Our experiments show that our approach is statistically better than the tilt-aim approach, and is comparable with the pure gamepad approach.},

While there exist several naturally-mapped interfaces, these have not been directly compared-in terms of presence, engagement, perceived performance, and real performance-to a more commonly-used interface for interacting with virtual reality: the gamepad. Because gamepads have evolved over several decades and have widespread adoption, it is pragmatic to ask whether it is viable to import them into the design of VR experiences. To study this, we developed a first-person shooter (FPS) Virtual environment and contrasted the VR experience using the Microsoft Xbox 360 controller against the HTC VIVE wand. We assessed the effect of the input device on self-reported presence, engagement, and performance as well as real performance in terms of accuracy and speed, two metrics relevant for our particular environment. A within-subjects FPS shooting task under accuracy and time constraints confirmed our hypotheses in favor of the VIVE wand: presence, engagement, perceived performance, and real performance were deemed significantly higher than the Xbox controller condition. These results are contextualized with participants"comments in a post-experiment debrief, in which (paradoxically) several participants reported preferring the gamepad. We discuss the implications of our findings and how what we call genre fidelity can impact the design of VR experiences.},

The system tracks the computer user's movements with a video camera and translates them into the movements of the mouse pointer on the screen. Body features such as the tip of the user's nose or finger can be tracked. The visual tracking algorithm is based on cropping an online template of the tracked feature from the current image frame and testing where this template correlates in the subsequent frame. The location of the highest correlation is interpreted as the new location of the feature in the subsequent frame. Various body features are examined for tracking robustness and user convenience. A group of 20 people without disabilities tested the Camera Mouse and quickly learned how to use it to spell out messages or play games. Twelve people with severe cerebral palsy or traumatic brain injury have tried the system, nine of whom have shown success. They interacted with their environment by spelling out messages and exploring the Internet.},

Existing solutions for detecting dangerous maneuvers are implemented either in only high-end vehicles or on smartphones as mobile applications. However, most of them rely on the use of cameras, the performance of which is seriously constrained by their high visibility requirement. Moreover, such an over/sole-reliance on the use of cameras can be a distraction to the driver. To alleviate these problems, we develop a vehicle steering detection middleware called V-Sense which can run on commodity smartphones without additional sensors or infrastructure support. Instead of using cameras, the core of V-Sense senses a vehicle's steering by only utilizing non- vision sensors on the smartphone. We design and evaluate algorithms for detecting and di erentiating various vehicle maneuvers, including lane-changes, turns, and driving on curvy roads. Since V-Sense does not rely on use of cameras, its detection of vehicle steering is not a ected by the (in)visibility of road objects or other vehicles. We first detail the design, implementation and evaluation of V-Sense and then demonstrate its practicality with two prevalent use cases: camera-free steering detection and fine-grained lane guidance. Our extensive evaluation results show that V- Sense is accurate in determining and di erentiating various steering maneuvers, and is thus useful for a wide range of safety-assistance applications without additional sensors or infrastructure.},

The key insight to realizing a fine-grained localization system is to exploit the extremely high sensitivity of cancellation performance (interference cancellation in full-duplex for example) to exact amplitude and phase matching. The receiver design introduces a delay mismatch between the received signal streams to guarantee imperfect cancellation across the transmission bandwidth except at one in-band frequency resulting in a trough in the cancellation spectrum. We detect keystrokes by forming an array of observed trough frequency across di erent antenna pairs. We implement our receiver system on the NI-based SDR platform. With full-training the receiver detects a keystroke within one key o set with an accuracy of 91.8\%. With a short ≈ 10 character training input, this accuracy drops to 85\%.},

OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a compounded muscular activity dynamics indicator (akin to percent relative range), enabling comparison between computer handheld pointing devices. METHODS: This muscular dynamism approach considers baseline muscular activity (APL, ECR, ECU and ED) relative to the Maximum Voluntary Contraction as well as the dynamics of muscular activation. The latter is computed as the ratio of the difference between APDF90 and APDF10 divided by APDF50 (APDF-Amplitude Probability Distribution Function for the 90th, 50th and 10th percentiles). The paper demonstrates the approach with results of comparative evaluation of a horizontal, a slanted and a vertical PC mouse, through surface EMG monitoring of 20 participants performing standardized graphical task with the devices. RESULTS: Hand size impacts muscular activity dynamics in these four muscles, which supersedes differences in device geometry, across the range of devices tested. CONCLUSION: Smaller devices relative to hand size foster more dynamic muscular activity.},

The vision based obstacle avoidance algorithm is presented in this paper, with extensions to UAV navigation. The proposed method is incorporated on a stereo vison multi copter using a block matching algorithm. The stereo vision baseline is based on horizontal configuration and computes the depth using a sum of absolute difference algorithm. The image processing node (LabVIEW vi) and the controller node are run on a remote laptop. This vi computes the distance between the multirotor and an obstacle and transmits depth data to an onboard flight controller through the MAVLink protocol. The algorithm efficiency was tested using the software in the loop on Gazebo simulator to analyze the performance of the UAV. The hardware in loop results are also shown in this paper after the successful flight test.},

After some delay, the controller joins this line-up, primarily as a wireless replacement for the keyboard and mouse. It is all about the ergonomics of dropping yourself comfortably on the couch and getting at least as good a gaming experience as you would in front of a PC workstation-based set-up. To that end, the Steam Controller incorporates two highly sensitive and responsive haptic pads that are intended to do much of what a mouse has traditionally accomplished, as well as a single joystick and series of programmable buttons.

(1994) pointed out that there still remains a paucity of work on the musculoskeletal problems associated specifically with computer mouse use. Likewise, there have been no published data on the magnitude of upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders associated with computer mouse use. In order to ascertain this magnitude, claims data from the Liberty Mutual Group were reviewed for the years 1986 to 1993, inclusive. Count, total cost and average cost per claim for all claims associated with computer use and computer mouse use were determined for the years in question. It was concluded that although there are few claims related to computer mouse use, it appears to be a growing problem, and therefore, perhaps, deserves more research and intervention attention. However, the present magnitude is less than for other musculoskeletal disorders. © 1995 Taylor and Francis Ltd.},

Present cameras (i.e., views were restricted to a predefined set of pan, tilt, and zoom coordinates) were also compared to manual cameras (i.e., no presets). The touchscreen interface was found to be more prone to produce errors in selecting cameras. Preset cameras were found to be superior to manual cameras in most aspects. The good performance of subjects using the keyboard interface is especially noteworthy. Implications for TMC design are discussed.}

However, little research has addressed the influence of game controls on player experience. In this paper, we examine the impact of mouse and keyboard versus gamepad control in first-person shooters using the PC and PlayStation 3 versions of Battlefield: Bad Company 2. We conducted a study with 45 participants to compare player experience and game usability issues of participants who had previously played similar games on one of the respective gaming systems, while also exploring the effects of players being forced to switch to an unfamiliar platform. The results show that players switching to a new platform experience more usability issues and consider themselves more challenged, but report an equally positive overall experience as players on their comfort platform.},

  abstract = {¡p¿Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) of the upper extremities and computer use are common in modern societies, and both show a growing trend. This study was conducted to determine the posture and 3D moments of wrist and elbow joints at different keyboard distances on a desk. Twelve healthy right-handed male volunteers attended the motion analysis laboratory. A keyboard was placed at three different distances from the participants' bodies while performing a standard computer task. The workstation was adjusted according to ANSI/HFES-100-2007 standard for each participant to maintain a comfortable ergonomic posture for controlling confounding variables. Qualisys motion capture system, OpenSim (Ver. 4.1), and visual analog scale were used to collect and analyze the data. The highest levels of wrist flexion and radial deviation as well as elbow flexion and pronation were observed when the keyboard was at the edge of the desk. When the keyboard was 8 cm away from the edge of the desk, the right wrist flexion and radial deviation decreased 83\% and 89\%, respectively. In the left wrist, flexion and radial deviation decreased 94\%. With increasing the distance of the keyboard from the edge of the desk, the right elbow flexion, pronation, and left elbow flexion decreased, 95\%, 76\%, and 85\%, respectively. No significant difference was found for the left elbow pronation, wrist, and elbow joint moments, in the studied keyboard distances. However, a cut-off point has to be specified because large keyboard distances cause high extension and flexion of the limbs. The keyboard position relative to the body is an important parameter in computer work and has a significant impact on the posture of the upper extremities. A keyboard should be located at a distance that allows the upper extremities to remain in a neutral position so that the risk of MSDs is reduced.¡/p¿}

While several works presented methods to analyze these factors, it is rare to find studies that evaluate the impact that the input methods (gamepads, touch, keyboards) have on the experience. We now introduce an exploratory user experience and usability study that compares two radically different game controllers: a mobile touch-based controller and a traditional gamepad, using subjective and objective user data. Results of this exploratory study indicate that while the general user experience and usability were similar with both controllers, the physiological measures indicate that the emotions differ between interfaces. In our final thoughts, we provide insights about how to evaluate and compare the experience with game controllers.},

To do this, we generate an inaudible tone, which gets frequency-shifted when it reflects off moving objects like the hand. We measure this shift with the microphone to infer various gestures. In this note, we describe the phenomena and detection algorithm, demonstrate a variety of gestures, and present an informal evaluation on the robustness of this approach across different devices and people.

Besides, the number of users who want to use their gamepads, which is the conventional input devices of video game consoles, has been gradually increasing. This study was designed to compare the performance and usability of two input devices, the gamepad and the keyboard-mouse setup, the traditional setup used by most PC users, by task type and difficulty level. The goal of this study is to explore the interface design guidelines for each device. In this study, we measured the reaction time for the performance and the perceived workload for usability. The results indicated that the keyboard-mouse setup showed higher performance than the gamepad in general, and that the difference by the difficulty level was intensified in the physical task group. However, this tendency was not found in the cognitive task group. The keyboard-mouse setup also showed lower mental demand and physical demand than the gamepad. This result suggests that designers should not require too many simultaneous inputs when designing interfaces for gamepads, and that users should understand the characteristics of each device, in order to choose the one appropriate for their intended goals.},

  abstract = {Currently, in the International System of Units (SI), reciprocal second (s-1) and radian per second (rad s-1) are the units of frequency ν and angular frequency ω, respectively. At the same time, these quantities are related in the SI by the simple mathematical relationship ω = 2πν. And here an evident conflict between this relation and the dimensions of the quantities included in it arises. When using the units in question, the two sides of this relation have different dimensions, which is not admissible in either physics or metrology. However, this situation has existed in metrology for many years. In 2019, the angular frequency with unit rad s-1 was included in the SI brochure. This article analyzes the reasons that have led to this conflict and establishes the relationship between frequency, angular frequency and angular velocity. An example of a simple oscillatory system shows that ω and ν have the same dimension, inverse to the dimension of the time. Therefore, they are measured by the same unit s-1. This does not coincide with the current definition of the unit of angular frequency in the SI, but fully corresponds to the laws of physics and removes the contradiction in the relation ω = 2πν. It is also shown that the angular frequency and angular velocity are independent quantities of different dimensions.},

The body posture that a person adopts while working has a significant impact on their health, working comfort, and productivity, but also on the quality of the fruit that is harvested. This paper identifies three characteristic picker positions during strawberry harvesting. A synchronized surface electromyography (sEMG) instrument to-gether with the Tekscan® surface pressure measurement system allowed for the determination of the influence of working position on changes in the load of the picker's musculoskeletal system and the surface pressure exerted on the fruit during manual strawberry picking, which are decisive factors for maintaining fruit quality. In addition, compression tests on whole strawberry fruit were carried out as a benchmark to evaluate and compare the maximum forces as well as the destructive pressures on the fruit. From the tests, we found that the most comfortable position of the worker's body was determined along with the harvesting technique (position during work) that has the least negative effect on the quality of the harvested fruit. Consequently, the level of dynamic load on the worker was determined.},

Ubicarse enables handheld devices to emulate large antenna arrays using a new formulation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Past work on SAR requires measuring mechanically controlled device movement with millimeter precision, far beyond what commercial accelerometers can provide. In contrast, Ubicarse's core contribution is the ability to perform SAR on handheld devices twisted by their users along unknown paths. Ubicarse is not limited to localizing RF devices; it combines RF localization with stereo-vision algorithms to localize common objects with no RF source attached to them. We implement Ubicarse on a HP SplitX2 tablet and empirically demonstrate a median error of 39 cm in 3-D device localization and 17 cm in object geotagging in complex indoor settings.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an indoor ultrasonic location tracking system that can utilize off-the-shelf audio speakers (potentially already in place) to provide fine-grained indoor position data to modern mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. We design and evaluate a communication primitive based on rate-adaptive wide-band linear frequency modulated chirp pulses that utilizes the audio bandwidth just above the human hearing frequency range where mobile devices are still sensitive. Typically transmitting data, even outside of this range, introduces broadband human audible noises (clicks) due to the non-ideal impulse response of speakers. Unlike existing audio modulation schemes, our scheme is optimized based on psychoacoustic properties. For example, all tones exhibit slowly changing power-levels and gradual frequency changes so as to minimize human perceivable artifacts. Chirps also bring the benefit of Pulse Compression, which greatly improves ranging resolution and makes them resilient to both Doppler shifts as well as multi-path propagation that typically plague indoor environments. The scheme also supports the decoding of multiple unique identifier packets being transmitted simultaneously. By applying a Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDOA) pseudo-ranging technique the mobile devices can localize themselves without tight out-of-band synchronization with the broadcasting infrastructure. This design is not only scalable with respect to the number of transmitters and tracked devices, but also improves user privacy since the mobile devices compute their positions locally. We show through user studies and experimentation on smartphones that we are able to provide submeter (95\%¡10cm) accurate indoor positioning in a manner that is imperceptible to humans.

Each modulation spectrum is then decomposed into several logarithmically-spaced modulation sub-bands. The modulation spectral contrast (MSC) and modulation spectral valley (MSV) are then computed from each modulation subband. Effective and compact features are generated from statistical aggregations of the MSCs and MSVs of all modulation subbands. An information fusion approach which integrates both feature level fusion method and decision level combination method is employed to improve the classification accuracy. Experiments conducted on two different music datasets have shown that our proposed approach can achieve higher classification accuracy than other approaches with the same experimental setup. © 2009 IEEE.},

First-person shooter (FPS) games have become increasingly popular, and the player's ability to accurately control their weapon and acquire targets quickly is very important. This was a two part study that assessed the effect of input device on FPS target acquisition. Study 1 assessed players' accuracy on eliminating targets in the FPS game Star Wars Battlefront II ??? using three different input devices (mouse, Playstation 2 (PS2) controller, and joystick) with two different weapon types (sniper rifle and blaster rifle). No significant differences in performance were found between input devices. However, participants did take fewer shots in the sniper rifle condition when using the joystick. There was a significant difference found between the rifle types, with participants taking fewer shots and less time to eliminate targets when using the sniper rifle. Trends observed in the results suggest different input devices are more effective for eliminating static versus moving targets. Study 2 assessed players' who were experts with one of the input devices performance at the same task using only the blaster rifle. Joystick users were trained on the device before completing the tasks to assure they were at the same level of performance as the mouse and PS2 participants. No significant differences were found between devices for time to kill targets. However, participants using the mouse took significantly fewer shots than those using either the joystick or the PS2 controller. This suggests that after training the mouse is the most efficient input device for first-person shooter target acquisition.},

  abstract = {In the referenced paper, Ian Mills addresses the confusion caused by the treatment of plane angle in the International System of Units (SI). As he points out, what the SI calls an 'angle' is not a dimensional physical quantity but, rather, the dimensionless numerical value of the angle when expressed in radians, thus creating widespread confusion regarding terminology and notation. For example, Mills shows that for the harmonic oscillator, if the conventional argument of the sinusoid represents an angle, it must be divided by a dimensional constant equal to one radian in order to correctly render it dimensionless, thereby greatly clarifying the notation. However, there is a problem with the author's interpretation of frequency. Although, for uniform rotation, Mills correctly defines the revolution frequency as the number of complete revolutions, N, divided by the time interval, he takes the unit for N to be 'cycle' (which he defines as one revolution) rather than the correct unit: the number one. The unit for 'frequency' then appears to be 'cycle per second' (i.e. revolution per second), whereas it should be one per second, correctly called hertz. Thus Mills concludes that 'frequency' is the same physical quantity as angular velocity and calls for the 'hertz' to be redefined as 2π rad s-1, a non-coherent derived unit for angular velocity. This misinterpretation of frequency corrupts the remainder of the author's discussion of the examples considered. In my comment, I explain and correct these and related errors.},

  abstract = {Because of continued confusion caused by the SI's interpretation of angle and solid angle as dimensionless quantities (and the radian and steradian as dimensionless derived units), it is time for the SI to treat these dimensional physical quantities correctly. Building on previous authors' foundations, starting from Euclid's Elements, I argue that angle should be recognized as a base quantity with an independent dimension: angle, A. A dimensionally consistent analysis of rotational geometry and mechanics results in the appearance of a constant of Nature equal to the central angle of a plane circular sector whose arc length is equal to that of its radius. This is the common (but not current SI) concept of the radian, rad, appropriately chosen as the base unit for angle. What the SI calls 'angle' is actually a nondimensionalized angle: the physical angle (dimension A) divided by one radian. Using a coordinate-system-independent definition of solid angle, I show that this is a derived quantity with dimension A 2 and appropriate unit radian-squared. The steradian is retained as a coherent derived unit: sr = rad2. Clarification of terminology is needed in distinguishing between 'geometrical' and 'mathematical' trigonometric functions and in related topics, including the distinction between frequency and angular velocity, and between phase and phase angle, among other things.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses reliable and accurate indoor localization using inertial sensors commonly found on commodity smartphones. We believe indoor positioning is an important primitive that can enable many ubiquitous computing applications. To tackle the challenges of drifting in estimation, sensitivity to phone position, as well as variability in user walking profiles, we have developed algorithms for reliable detection of steps and heading directions, and accurate estimation and personalization of step length. We've built an end-to-end localization system integrating these modules and an indoor floor map, without the need for infrastructure assistance. We demonstrated for the first time a meterlevel indoor positioning system that is infrastructure free, phone position independent, user adaptive, and easy to deploy. We have conducted extensive experiments on users with smartphone devices, with over 50 subjects walking over an aggregate distance of over 40 kilometers. Evaluation results showed our system can achieve a mean accuracy of 1.5m for the in-hand case and 2m for the in-pocket case in a 31m×15m testing area. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

Overall, multi-touch was slightly faster than the GamePad in the search for objects. Experienced users performed significantly better when using the GamePad, compared to casual gamers. When casual gamers were analyzed separately, their performance was better (at a statistically significant level) with the multi-touch display, compared to the GamePad. Finally, users had a significantly higher error rate when switching from the GamePad to the keyboard, than when switching from the multi-touch to the keyboard.}

In particular, visual interpretation of hand gestures can help in achieving the ease and naturalness desired for HCI. This has motivated a very active research area concerned with computer vision-based analysis and interpretation of hand gestures. We survey the literature on visual interpretation of hand gestures in the context of its role in HCI. This discussion is organized on the basis of the method used for modeling, analyzing, and recognizing gestures. Important differences in the gesture interpretation approaches arise depending on whether a 3D model of the human hand or an image appearance model of the human hand is used. 3D hand models offer a way of more elaborate modeling of hand gestures but lead to computational hurdles that have not been overcome given the real-time requirements of HCI. Appearance-based models lead to computationally efficient "purposive" approaches that work well under constrained situations but seem to lack the generality desirable for HCI. We also discuss implemented gestural systems as well as other potential applications of vision-based gesture recognition. Although the current progress is encouraging, further theoretical as well as computational advances are needed before gestures can be widely used for HCI. We discuss directions of future research in gesture recognition, including its integration with other natural modes of humancomputer interaction. © 1997 IEEE.},

It operates in a spontaneous, ad-hoc, and device-to-device context without leveraging any pre-planned infrastructure. It is a pure software-based solution and uses only the most basic set of commodity hardware - a speaker, a microphone, and some form of device-to-device communication - so that it is readily applicable to many low-cost sensor platforms and to most commercial-off-the-shelf mobile devices like cell phones and PDAs. It achieves high accuracy through a combination of three techniques: two-way sensing, selfrecording, and sample counting. The basic idea is the following. To estimate the range between two devices, each will emit a specially-designed sound signal ("Beep") and collect a simultaneous recording from its microphone. Each recording should contain two such beeps, one from its own speaker and the other from its peer. By counting the number of samples between these two beeps and exchanging the time duration information with its peer, each device can derive the two-way time of flight of the beeps at the granularity of sound sampling rate. This technique cleverly avoids many sources of inaccuracy found in other typical time-of-arrival schemes, such as clock synchronization, non-real-time handling, software delays, etc. Our experiments on two common cell phone models have shown that we can achieve around one or two centimeters accuracy within a range of more than ten meters, despite a series of technical challenges in implementing the idea.

Since wireless signals do not require line-of-sight and can traverse through walls, WiSee can enable wholehome gesture recognition using few wireless sources. Further, it achieves this goal without requiring instrumentation of the human body with sensing devices. We implement a proof-ofconcept prototype of WiSee using USRP-N210s and evaluate it in both an office environment and a two-bedroom apartment. Our results show that WiSee can identify and classify a set of nine gestures with an average accuracy of 94\%. © 2013 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.},

  abstract = {High-speed, locational, phone-to-phone (HLPP) games and apps constitute a provocative class of mobile apps that are currently unsupported on commodity mobile devices. This work looks at a key problem for enabling HLPP: a specific variant of the localization problem in which two phones estimate each other's relative positions in 3D space without infrastructure support. Moreover, position estimates should reflect changes due to the phones' possible mobility. We present a solution for achieving high speed 3D continuous localization for phone-to-phone scenarios. Our basic approach uses acoustic cues based on time-of-arrival and power level. It assumes at least two microphones and one speaker per phone, which is common on new smartphones. Accelerometers and digital compasses assist in resolving ambiguous acoustic-only localization. Continuous localization is achieved with the aid of a loose time synchronization protocol and an extended Kalman filter. Experimental results across a range of motion paths show localization resolution to within 13.9 centimeters for 90\% of estimates, and to within 4.9 centimeters for 50\% of estimates when the phones are several meters apart. © 2011 ACM.},

  abstract = {Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting, based onWiFi or cellular signals, has been a popular approach to indoor localization. However, its adoption in the real world has been stymied by the need for sitespecific calibration, i.e., the creation of a training data set comprising WiFi measurements at known locations in the space of interest. While efforts have been made to reduce this calibration effort using modeling, the need for measurements from known locations still remains a bottleneck. In this paper, we present Zee - a system that makes the calibration zero-effort, by enabling training data to be crowdsourced without any explicit effort on the part of users. Zee leverages the inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer, compass, gyroscope) present in the mobile devices such as smartphones carried by users, to track them as they traverse an indoor environment, while simultaneously performing WiFi scans. Zee is designed to run in the background on a device without requiring any explicit user participation. The only site-specific input that Zee depends on is a map showing the pathways (e.g., hallways) and barriers (e.g., walls). A significant challenge that Zee surmounts is to track users without any a priori, user-specific knowledge such as the user's initial location, stride-length, or phone placement. Zee employs a suite of novel techniques to infer location over time: (a) placement-independent step counting and orientation estimation, (b) augmented particle filtering to simultaneously estimate location and user-specific walk characteristics such as the stride length, (c) back propagation to go back and improve the accuracy of localization in the past, and (d) WiFi-based particle initialization to enable faster convergence. We present an evaluation of Zee in a large office building. Copyright © 2012 ACM.},

The current study compared the performance of a joystick and keyboard interface with that of an Xbox controller in both a low and high difficulty task. The results indicate that the Xbox controller had lower tracking errors and trended to lower workload and a slightly higher usability score as measured by the system usability scale (SUS). An interaction between difficulty and controller was not found, however allowing for a longer practice time with the interfaces may have shown significant differences which are planned in a future study. Overall these results indicate favorable results that an Xbox controller may be a viable control interface for complex human system interaction tasks.},

The proposed approach is a real-time hand tracking process based on webcam to navigate a computer. With the help of Kalman filter mouse pointer flickering was reduced and gained a better accuracy and smoothness for mouse pointer movement. The system focuses on navigating computers, reading documents and controlling multimedia like videos, pictures etc. So, we designed our system for three different modes as, Navigation, Reading, and Multimedia mode. We implemented Leap Motion device for switching to different modes and developed different types of hand gestures as swiping and tilting hand. This approach can ensure user comforts and prevent ergonomic injuries. The developed system Hand Swifter-not only improves better computer using experience but also helps to prevent repetitive strain injuries caused by traditional input devices such as mouse and keyboard.},

Effects of ergonomic factors on musculoskeletal discomfort were clearly evident in the analyses. Regression models explained up to 38\% of the variance in discomfort at different body sites. Of special interest was that leg discomfort increased with low, soft seat pans, suggesting that postural constraint is more important than thigh compression as a risk factor for leg discomfort in VDT work. In addition, arm discomfort increased with increases in keyboard height above elbow level, supporting arguments for low placement of the keyboard. Finally, high levels of neck and shoulder girdle discomfort observed in the study population suggest the need for further attention to the control of cervicobrachial pain syndromes in VDT work.},

In the former, the infrastructure has receivers at known locations, which estimate distances to a mobile device based on an active transmission from the device. In the latter, the infrastructure has active beacons that periodically transmit signals to a passively listening mobile device, which in turn estimates distances to the beacons. Because the active mobile architecture receives simultaneous distance estimates at multiple receivers from the mobile device, it is likely to perform better tracking than the passive mobile system in which the device obtains only one distance estimate at a time and may have moved between successive estimates. However, an passive mobile system scales better with the number of mobile devices and puts users in control of whether their whereabouts are tracked. We answer the following question: How do the two architectures compare in tracking performance? We find that the active mobile architecture performs better at tracking, but that the passive mobile architecture has acceptable performance; moreover, we devise a hybrid approach that preserves the benefits of the passive mobile architecture while simultaneously providing the same performance as an active mobile system, suggesting a viable practical solution to the three goals of scalability, privacy, and tracking agility.},

This thesis debates their advantages and limitations for the creation of a three-dimensional mouse prototype, using a game controller equipped with these sensors.  After describing their functioning and highlighting which kind of applications they already support, the work focuses on the design and the implementation of a library for managing a three-dimensional pointer abstraction.  In order to address the position drift problem, due to the fact that an accelerometer cannot distinguish between the gravity and input acceleration, two motion-tracking algorithms are proposed: the first one is based only on a three-axial accelerometer and is able to recognize either linear motion on three axes or rotation about two axes. The second one, combining the input of an accelerometer and a gyroscope, can recognize linear motion and rotation on three axes at the same time. The abstraction is tested in a three dimensional environment where the user can move and rotate the pointer, register and analyse movement data.  In conclusion are discussed the possible application of the results in windows systems and for future works.},

The two groups exhibited few differences in their experience of work-related physical discomfort, in job satisfaction, or in their concerns about job security. Both groups were found to use eyeglasses and contact lenses to the same extent. VDT operators generally did not obtain special corrective lenses for work. The results show that replacing paper documents with VDTs need not adversely affect the comfort and morale of office workers.},

In this paper, we propose Spartacus, a mobile system that enables spatially-aware neighboring device interactions with zero prior configuration. Using built-in microphones and speakers on commodity mobile devices, Spartacus uses a novel acoustic technique based on the Doppler e\# ect to enable users to accurately initiate an interaction with a neighboring device through a pointing gesture. To enable truly spontaneous interactions on energy-constrained mobile devices, Spartacus uses a continuous audio-based lower-power listening mechanism to trigger the gesture detection service. This eliminates the need for any manual action by the user. Experimental results show that Spartacus achieves an average 90\% device selection accuracy within 3m for most interaction scenarios. Our energy consumption evaluations show that, Spartacus achieves about 4X lower energy consumption than WiFi Direct and 5.5X lower than the latest Bluetooth 4.0 protocols. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

Day in, day out people interact with various devices that follow different user interaction paradigms, such as when they are using a mobile phone, smart TV or a gaming console. Although these devices have various forms among themselves, the interaction method used to control them can make a significant difference in usability. Gaming consoles have become a huge area of the computer entertainment business in years. With every new generation of gaming consoles, the technologies behind it improve dramatically. Most of the time, the improvements are about the graphics and interaction devices. It can be clearly said that even though the graphics have improved in the last two generations of gaming consoles, the interaction paradigms and approaches were not up to the users’ expectations. This is especially the case for a first-person shooter and real-time strategy (RTS) games. Accordingly, bearing in mind the above as a motivation, the aim of this work is to develop a prototype game controller that will improve the usability and gameplay experience of the first-person shooter games.},

  abstract = {A study by Slater, et al., [1995] indicated that naive subjects in an immersive virtual environment experience a higher subjective sense of presence when they locomote by walking-in-place (virtual walking) than when they push-button-fly (along the floor plane). We replicated their study, adding real walking as a third condition. Our study confirmed their findings. We also found that real walking is significantly better than both virtual walking and flying in ease (simplicity, straightforwardness, naturalness) as a mode of locomotion. The greatest difference in subjective presence was between flyers and both kinds of walkers. In addition, subjective presence was higher for real walkers than virtual walkers, but the difference was statistically significant only in some models. Follow-on studies show virtual walking can be substantially improved by detecting footfalls with a head accelerometer. As in the Slater study, subjective presence significantly correlated with subjects' degree of association with their virtual bodies (avatars). This, our strongest statistical result, suggests that substantial potential presence gains can be had from tracking all limbs and customizing avatar appearance. An unexpected by-product was that real walking through our enhanced version of Slater's visual-cliff virtual environment (Figure 1) yielded a strikingly compelling virtual experience - The strongest we and most of our visitors have yet experienced. The most needed system improvement is the substitution of wireless technology for all links to the user. Copyright ACM 1999.},

  abstract = {RFIDs are emerging as a vital component of the Internet of Things. In 2012, billions of RFIDs have been deployed to locate equipment, track drugs, tag retail goods, etc. Current RFID systems, however, can only identify whether a tagged object is within radio range (which could be up to tens of meters), but cannot pinpoint its exact location. Past proposals for addressing this limitation rely on a line-of-sight model and hence perform poorly when faced with multipath effects or non-line-of-sight, which are typical in real-world deployments. This paper introduces the first fine-grained RFID positioning system that is robust to multipath and non-line-of-sight scenarios. Unlike past work, which considers multipath as detrimental, our design exploits multipath to accurately locate RFIDs. The intuition underlying our design is that nearby RFIDs experience a similar multipath environment (e.g., reflectors in the environment) and thus exhibit similar multipath profiles. We capture and extract these multipath profiles by using a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) created via antenna motion. We then adapt dynamic time warping (DTW) techniques to pinpoint a tag's location. We built a prototype of our design using USRP software radios. Results from a deployment of 200 commercial RFIDs in our university library demonstrate that the new design can locate misplaced books with a median accuracy of 11∼cm. © 2013 ACM.},

However, many applications in gaming and gesture based interface see more benefits in knowing the detailed shape of a motion. Such trajectory tracing requires a resolution several fold higher than what existing RF-based positioning systems can offer. This paper shows that one can provide a dramatic increase in trajectory tracing accuracy, even with a small number of antennas. The key enabler for our design is a multi-resolution positioning technique that exploits an intrinsic tradeoff between improving the resolution and resolving ambiguity in the location of the RF source. The unique property of this design is its ability to precisely reconstruct the minute details in the trajectory shape, even when the absolute position might have an offset. We built a prototype of our design with commercial off-the-shelf RFID readers and tags and used it to enable a virtual touch screen, which allows a user to interact with a desired computing device by gesturing or writing her commands in the air, where each letter is only a few centimeters wide.},

  abstract = {Background:Growing industrialization of China exposes its labor population to the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of MSDs in a modern industrial region of Beijing.Methods:A cross-sectional study included 1415 employees in six industrial companies was conducted between January 2018 and May 2018 in Fangshan district, Beijng, China. Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) was used to collect the information about MSDs. Demographic factors, lifestyle factors, health and medical factors, and work-related factors were collected as independent variables. Descriptive statistics, the chi-squared (χ2) test, and binary logistic regression analysis were used to analyze data.Results:Among 1415 participants, 498 reported MSDs. The regions involved were the neck (25.16\%), shoulders (17.17\%), and upper back (13.29\%). There was a significant statistical difference between frontline industrial workers and other staff in the prevalence of self-reported symptoms involving the shoulders (χ2 = 4.33, P = 0.037), wrists and hands (χ2 = 8.90, P = 0.003), and ankles and feet (χ2 = 12.88, P ¡ 0.001). Increased age (P = 0.005, OR = 1.63; P = 0.001, OR = 2.33), a high or a low salary (P ¡ 0.001, OR = 0.49; P ¡ 0.001, OR = 0.30), night-shift (P = 0.027, OR = 1.46), two-week-history of illness and treatment (P = 0.004, OR = 5.60; P = 0.013, OR = 4.19), concurrent chronic diseases (P = 0.001, OR = 3.45; P = 0.092, OR = 7.81), limited access to health information (P = 0.004, OR = 0.49), and negative attitude towards seeking healthcare (P = 0.010, OR = 1.77; P = 0.009, OR = 2.75) were associated with MSDs in frontline workers. Female gender (P ¡ 0.001, OR = 2.30), high education (P = 0.001, OR = 1.96), no exercises (P = 0.027, OR = 0.59), night-shift (P = 0.017, OR = 1.98), concurrent chronic diseases (P = 0.002, OR = 3.73; P = 0.020, OR = 13.42), limited access to health information (P = 0.013, OR = 0.53), far distance to medical institution (P = 0.009, OR = 1.83), and negative propensity (P = 0.009, OR = 1.94; P = 0.014, OR = 2.74) were associated with MSDs in other staffs.Conclusions:The prevalence of MSDs among industrial employees has changed. Frontline workers had different prevalence and risk factors for MSDs compared with other employees. Negative propensity to healthcare, limited ways to obtain health knowledge, and concomitant chronic diseases were associated with MSDs. Surprisingly, highly educated and high-income employees had a higher risk of MSDs.},

Cost data were gathered from computerized records of the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company for low back pain workers' compensation claims (N = 119, 107) and for all claims (N = 731, 087) initiated from 45 jurisdictions (states) during 1989. Objective. This study provided more current, accurate, and additional information to estimate the costs and incidence associated with compensable low back pain compared with all compensation claims. Methods. The first group of data included all compensable low back claims selected by specific codes: body part codes consisted of low back area, sacrum and coccyx, disc, and multiple trunk; injury codes consisted of strain, sprain, inflammation, rupture, hernia, fracture, and contusion, The secord sample included all compensable claims, including both occupational injuries and illnesses. Results. Louu back pain cases represented 16\% of all claims but 33\% of all claims costs; 55.4\% of the low back pain cases received medical payments only (i.e., did not receive indemnity payments for lost time). The mean cost per case for low back pain was 8321: median cost per case was 396. Medical costs represented 32.4\% of the total costs indemnity costs (i.e., payment for lost time) represented 65.8\%. Conclusions. Since indemnity costs represent the greatest percentage of workers' compensation expenditure, the primary goal of low back pain management should be the prevention or reduction of prolonged disability. © 1994, J.B.

In all, 1080 gestures from 20 participants were logged, analyzed, and paired with think-aloud data for 27 commands performed with 1 and 2 hands. Our findings indicate that users rarely care about the number of fingers they employ, that one hand is preferred to two, that desktop idioms strongly influence users' mental models, and that some commands elicit little gestural agreement, suggesting the need for on-screen widgets. We also present a complete user-defined gesture set, quantitative agreement scores, implications for surface technology, and a taxonomy of surface gestures. Our results will help designers create better gesture sets informed by user behavior. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

  abstract = {This paper presents results from two experiments which compared gestural and keyboard interfaces to a spreadsheet program. This is the first quantitative comparison of these two types of interfaces known to the author. The gestural interface employed gestures (hand-drawn marks such as carets or brackets) for commands, and handwriting as input techniques. In one configuration, the input/output hardware consisted of a transparent digitizing tablet mounted on top of an LCD which allowed the user to interact with the program by writing on the tablet with a stylus. The experiments found that participants were faster with the gestural interface. Specifically, subjects performed the operations in about 72\% of the time taken with the keyboard. In addition, there was a preference for the gestural interface over the keyboard interface. These findings are explained in terms of the fewer number of movements required to carry out an operation with the gestural interface, the greater ease of remembering gestural commands, and the benefits of performing operations directly on objects of interest.}

  abstract = {In this work, we present an RFID-based system, Tagoram, for object localization and tracking using COTS RFID tags and read- ers. Tracking mobile RFID tags in real time has been a daunting task, especially challenging for achieving high precision. Our sys- tem achieves these three goals by leveraging the phase value of the backscattered signal, provided by the COTS RFID readers, to es- timate the location of the object. In Tagoram, we exploit the tag's mobility to build a virtual antenna array by using readings from a few physical antennas over a time window. To illustrate the basic idea of our system, we firstly focus on a simple scenario where the tag is moving along a fixed track known to the system. We pro- pose Differential Augmented Hologram (DAH) which will facili- tate the instant tracking of the mobile RFID tag to a high precision. We then devise a comprehensive solution to accurately recover the tag's moving trajectories and its locations, relaxing the assumption of knowing tag's track function in advance. We have implemented the Tagoram system using COTS RFID tags and readers. The system has been tested extensively in the lab environment and used for more than a year in real airline ap- plications. For lab environment, we can track the mobile tags in real time with a millimeter accuracy to a median of 5mm and 7.29mm using linear and circular track respectively. In our year- long large scale baggage sortation systems deployed in two air- ports, our results from real deployments show that Tagoram can achieve a centimeter-level accuracy to a median of 6.35cmin these real deployments. In many applications, we have to identify an object and then locate the object to within high precision (centimeter- or millimeter-level). Legacy systems that can provide such accuracy are either expensive or suffering from performance degradation resulting from various impacts, e.g., occlusion for computer vision based approaches.

  abstract = {Recently, plant-based repellents have been proposed as a potential alternative to classic pesticides against pest wasps, in certain scenarios. Here, the repellent effect of Dysphania multifida essential oil and one of its main terpenoid components, α-terpinene, were tested under field conditions with natural populations of wasps in Patagonia Argentina. D. multifida essential oil (paico), as well as α-terpinene, repelled V. germanica wasps in the field. A strong avoidance of food baits treated with the essential oil or α-terpinene was observed in choice and no-choice tests. In no-choice tests, the time it took wasps to arrive at the bait was significantly greater in treated baits than in control baits. Also, the total number of arriving wasps in 30 min was significantly greater in untreated baits in comparison with treated baits, under similar environmental conditions and wasp density. As the wasps' flight season progressed, wasp density and motivation for proteinaceous food sources increased. This was evidenced by a greater total number of wasps in untreated baits with time. On the contrary, the number of wasps in treated baits remained low throughout the peak season. Both the paico essential oil and the α-terpinene act as powerful repellents for V. germanica wasps, generating an avoidance response to treated food sources. Thus, these compounds have potential to be used as repellents to prevent wasps' approaches and foraging, when applied in close proximity to a food source.},

  abstract = {A mouse has been one of the most successful user interfaces due to its intuitive use. As more devices are equipped with displays and offer rich options for users to choose from, a traditional mouse that requires a surface to operate is no longer sufficient. While different types of air mice are available in the market, they rely on accelerometers and gyroscopes, which significantly limit the accuracy and ease of use. In this paper, we develop a system that can accurately track hand movement to realize a mouse. A unique advantage of our scheme is that it achieves high tracking accuracy using the existing hardware already available in the mobile devices (e.g., smart phones and smart watches) and equipment to be controlled (e.g., smart TVs). More specifically, our approach sends inaudible sound pulses at a few selected frequencies, and uses the frequency shifts to estimate the speed and distance traveled. We then develop techniques to quickly calibrate the distance between speakers and narrow down the device's initial position using its movement trajectory. Based on the information, we continuously track the device's new position in real time. This is feasible because many devices, such as smart TVs, PCs, and laptops, already have multiple speakers. When only one speaker is available, we can leverage the frequency shift of sound along with the phase of received WiFi signal to enable tracking. Our evaluation and user study demonstrate that our system achieves high tracking accuracy (e.g., median error of around 1.4 cm) and ease of use.},

  abstract = {Mobile gaming is a big driver of app marketplaces. However, few mobile games deliver truly distinctive gameplay experiences for ad hoc collocated users. As an example of such an experience, consider a sword fight dual between two users facing each other where each user's phone simulates a sword. With phone in hand, the users' thrusts and blocks translate to attacks and counterattacks in the game. Such Phone-to-Phone Mobile Motion Games (MMG) represent interesting and novel gameplay for ad hoc users in the same location. One enabler for an MMG game like sword fight is continuous, accurate distance ranging. Existing ranging schemes cannot meet the stringent requirements of MMG games: speed, accuracy and noise robustness. In this work, we design FAR, a new ranging scheme that can localize at 12Hz with 2cm median error while withstanding up to 0dB noise, multipath and Doppler effect issues. Our implementation runs on commodity smartphones and does not require any external infrastructure. Moreover, distance measurement accuracy is comparable to that of Kinect, a fixed-infrastructure motion capture system. Evaluation on users playing two prototype games indicate that FAR can fully support dynamic game motion in real-time. © 2012 ACM.},

Several common essential oils and their compositions were tested against BMSBs as potential repellents. All the tested individual essential oils and a ternary oil blend showed significant repellency to both BMSB nymphs and adults. Clove oil, lemongrass oil, spearmint oil, ylang-ylang oil, and the ternary oil mixture (clove, lemongrass and spearmint) almost completely blocked attraction of BMSBs to the stink bug attractant-baited traps; whereas wintergreen oil, geranium oil, pennyroyal oil and rosemary oil resulted in 60-85\% trap catch reductions. Over 20 BMSB antennally active compounds were identified from SPME headspace samples of the eight repellent essential oils using GC-EAD and GC-MS techniques. Among the synthetic EAD-active compounds tested in the field, eugenol, l-carvone, p/l-menthone, pulegone, methyl salicylate, trans/cis-citral, methyl benzoate and β-caryophyllene significantly reduced trap catches of BMSBs by 72-99\%; these compounds are likely responsible for the repellency of their corresponding essential oils. Surprisingly, a synthetic mixture of the predacious spined soldier bug (SSB) [Podisus maculiventris (Say)] aggregation pheromone (trans-2-hexenal, α-terpineol and benzyl alcohol) also showed a significant inhibition of BMSB response to its attractants. These repellent essential oils and their active compounds, as well as the synthetic SSB pheromone, are potentially useful as part of an efficient, environmentally sound semiochemical-based IPM programme to combat this serious invasive stink bug. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

Only four force sensitive resistors ( FSRs) are placed around the wrist to capture the wrist pressure distribution of different hand gestures. A novel real-time recognition framework is proposed to accurately and quickly identify the starting and ending position of the gesture. In the proposed framework, a pressure-parameter adaptive updating strategy is designed for improving the robust of the system to cope with different hand positions, different users and re-wear scenarios. To ensure the real-time of the system, we design some simple features and classifiers to recognize hand gestures for decreasing the time complexity. In addition, the WristMouse prototype has a small volume, a low energy consumption and is easy to integrate with the normal wearable devices like smart watch and smart wristband. Our study shows that the proposed system has a good performance in the real-time hand gesture recognition with a high F-score of 92.55\%, and the average time delay per second is less than 50ms for processing data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The study objectives were: (1) to field test potential repellency of common essential oils against several pestiferous social wasps (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), using attractant-baited traps; (2) to identify vespid antennally active compounds from the repellent essential oils; (3) to determine potential repellency of these electroantennographic detection (EAD) active compounds in the field. RESULTS: Of the 21 essential oils tested, 17 showed significant repellency on yellowjackets [mainly Vespula pensylvanica (Saussure)] and paper wasps [mainly Polistes dominulus (Christ)]: clove, pennyroyal, lemongrass, ylang ylang, spearmint, wintergreen, sage, rosemary, lavender, geranium, patchouli, citronella, Roman chamomile, thyme, fennel seed, anise and peppermint. Two essential oil mixtures – 3EO-mix (clove, geranium and lemongrass) and 4EO-mix (clove, geranium, lemongrass and rosemary) – totally blocked the attraction of vespid workers. Twenty-nine vespid antennally active compounds were identified from solid-phase microextraction (SPME) samples of 11 strongly repellent essential oils by GC-EAD/MS techniques. Among the synthetic EAD-active compounds field tested, eugenol, P/I-menthone, pulegone, α/β-thujone, l-carvone, E/Z-citral, citronellal, methyl benzoate, benzyl acetate, methyl salicylate and 3-octanol showed a significant repellency on vespid workers. These compounds are likely responsible for the repellency of their corresponding essential oils. CONCLUSION: These repellent essential oils and their active compositions have great potential for efficient, environmentally sound semiochemical-based IPM of pestiferous vespid wasps. c 2012 Society of Chemical Industry},
